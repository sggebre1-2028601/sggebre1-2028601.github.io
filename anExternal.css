        Lobo was a grey wolf that lived in North America, he had built his repuation by evading every hunter in his state.
        He would use his senses to detect cattles that were posionouse, traps that were scattered around his territory, and
        figure out fake wolf whistles. His bounty quickly grew to the thousands and hunters from all over were flying in to kill
        him. His tragic end came when the love of his life was captured and killed. This caused him to think irrational and attack 
        the hunters which resulted in him getting captured. He refused all food and drinks provided to him. He later died in 
        custody.
