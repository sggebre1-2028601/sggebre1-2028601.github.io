Ã‚# Assignment 1: Protests
The past few years in the United States, there has been a surge in protests in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and other social issues. In this assignment, you'll work with data from [CountLove](https://countlove.org/) -- the same data often [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the New York Times -- to learn more about demonstrations over the past few years.

By completing the assignment, you will demonstrate the following skills:

- Use of **version control** for managing your code
- Declaring document rendering using **markdown** syntax
- Foundational programming skills in R.


## Background Research
Before diving into this (or any) dataset, it's important to have _domain familiarity_ (i.e., to know something about the topic). As preparation, I'm asking that you read **three articles** about protests in the U.S., and provide a brief 1 - 2 sentence summary or takeaway from each one.
test
In the section below, create an **unordered list** of the three articles you found. Make sure to provide an appropriate markdown link (_not_ just the URL) to the article in addition to your 1 - 2 sentence summary.
[93-of-racial-justice-protests-in-u-s-have-been-peaceful](https://fox5sandiego.com/news/national-news/about-93-of-racial-justice-protests-in-u-s-have-been-peaceful-new-report-finds/) 93% of BLM protests have been peaceful. In many cases BLM counter-protests and authority interventions are responsible for escalating protests.
[counterprotests-black-lives-matter-violent](https://www.vox.com/2020/9/14/21432330/counterprotests-black-lives-matter-violent) Far right wing militia and trump supporters show up armed to scare BLM protesters.Counter protesters. Counter-protesters have the desire to stop social change and keep things the way they are because it favors them.
[BLM-is-the-largest-movement-in-US-history](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html) BLM protests hold the record for the highest amount of protester participation. More wealthy, young, and white people are joining BLM protests compared to the past BLM protests.
## Accompanying Image
In this section, please **display one image** to accompany your text, and describe _why_ you included it (~2 - 3 sentences). This will require that you download an image into your project folder. In your description, use **bold** and _italics_ (at least once, for practice) to emphasize some of your points.

This shows how police can build a better relationship with by responding peacefully and listening to the community. Protests met with violent police end up as **riots**

![Social injustice](plm.jpg)

This shows that more people are starting to wake up to _social injustice_. BLM has started the largest  movement in the world.

![violent Magas](portand.jpg)

This shows how some protests turn violent and in some cases turn deadly. Counter-protesters are _scared_ of change because the system favors them.




## Analysis
At this point, you should open up your `analysis.R` script to begin working with the data. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data. Throughout the script, there are prompts labeled **Reflection**. Please write 1 - 2 sentences for each of these reflections below:

- What does the difference between the mean and the median tell you about the *distribution* of the data? The distribution is growing especially with the rise of protests.
- Does the number of protests in Washington surprise you? Why or why not? No because WA is a very progressive State
- Looking at the `state_table` variable, what data quality issues do you notice, and how would you use that to change your analysis (no need to actually change your analysis)? It has na and I could "omit na" to just get numbers I need.
- Does the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020 surprise you? Why or why not?
- Do a bit of research. Find at least *two specific policies* that have been changed as a result of protests in 2020. These may be at the city, state, or University level. Please provide a basic summary, as well as a link to each article.Police are required to fill out an instance report if they  pointing their guns.
This would help keep officers think twice before they resort to deadly force.

The use of deadly force is reported to to the city citizen board for review.
This would help prevent police departments from lying about evidence and
hiding the truth.

- Take a look (`View()`) your `high_level_table` variable. What picture does this paint of the U.S.?
he picture I get from looking at the table is a finished painting of the
constitution because America still has to live up to the foundation of what it
says it lives up to in the constitution.
## Final Thoughts
When you are finished, with your analysis, please answer the following questions in 1-2 sentences each.

- What about the analysis surprised you? That more people are starting to protest more even during the pandemic
- What parts of this analysis did you find challenging? finding specific details about the data and functions
- What types of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset, but currently don't have the technical skills to do? Mostly everything, I spent more than half the time on google and reading back the book.
